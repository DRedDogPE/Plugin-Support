# Plugin-Support
I will try to offer my help to budding pocketmine plugin developers. 

### How to get support:
Create an issue about what you need help with and i will try to help you create/fix your plugins.
#### Format:
If you need to paste a snippet of code use the github markdown fenced code blocks with syntax highlighting for PHP
E.g.

```php
<?php
namespace NAMESPACE;
//more code
```
